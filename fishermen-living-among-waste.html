        <h6><strong> The Threat of Microplastics to Oceans and Human Health </strong></h6>
        <h4><p>On a quiet morning at Sukaraja Beach, Lampung Province, fishermen rush to their boats. The sea breeze blows gently, as if whispering old stories about the ocean that was once a source of abundant life. However, behind the tranquility of that morning, there is an unseen yet haunting threat, something that is destroying not only the ocean, but also the people who live from the sea.</p>
          <p>Below the surface of the sea, millions of Sardines swim, as if undisturbed by the hustle and bustle of the world above the water. They are one of the main species caught by the fishermen of Sukaraja Beach. These fish, known by the scientific name Sardina pilchardus, are a delicacy on the tables of families around the world. But now, without realizing it, these fish may be carrying something far more dangerous than just small bones-they are carrying microplastic particles that are barely visible to the human eye.</p>
          <p>Trillions of microplastic particles are in the ocean, coming from plastic waste that continues to flow from land into the ocean every day. In 2015, Jambeck Research Group released a research report “Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean” conducted in 192 countries. In the report, in 2010 Indonesia contributed around 1.3 million tons of plastic waste to the ocean each year, ranked second in the world after China. Mismanaged plastic waste in Indonesia amounted to 3.22 million tons per year, below China at 8.82 million tons of plastic waste per year. This number is predicted to continue to increase until it reaches 7.4 million tons in 2025. While the plastic waste floating in the ocean gradually disintegrates into small particles, a greater danger is looming.</p>
          <p>These waste is very difficult to decompose, can last hundreds of years, and in the process of decomposition, they break into smaller fragments. These particles are then called Microplastics and are unknowingly eaten by fish and other marine organisms. According to a report from the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, more than 800 marine species are now threatened by plastic waste in the ocean. Among these species, Sardines, commonly caught by Sukaraja fishermen, are one of the invisible victims of this pollution.</p>
          <p>They should be a source of protein and nutritious food for humans, but are now a potential source of harm. The microplastics they ingest not only endanger the health of the fish, but also the humans who consume them. Microplastic residue in the human body can cause irritation, inflammation, and in the long run, trigger the growth of tumors and even cancer.</p>
          <p>However, the threat does not stop at human health. Garbage is also polluting the coast and destroying the natural beauty that is a source of income for the tourism sector. The ocean waves that once brought prosperity now bring invisible dangers. Beaches that were once teeming with tourists are gradually losing their appeal due to littering.</p>
          <p>This is the reality that the world faces today. Behind the beauty of Sukaraja Beach, behind the tranquility of the sea, the threat of waste and microplastics continues to lurk, bringing dire impacts to marine ecosystems and human life. Among the fishermen who set sail that morning, perhaps no one realized that the fish they brought home were no longer just fish, but also messengers of how precarious the condition of our oceans is.</p>
          <p>If the ocean continues to be polluted, it is not only the fish that will slowly die, but also us, humans, who live from it.</p>
          </h4>

          <h6><strong> Sukaraja Beach Fishermen, Living Among Waste </strong></h6>
          <h4><p>On Sunday morning, September 15, 2024, Sukaraja beach in Bandar Lampung City was abuzz with the excited voices of fishermen. With their muscles strained, they pull nets from the sea, trying to catch the fish that provide their daily livelihood. For them, there is no day off. Every day, with unwavering dedication, they still go to the beach to spread and pull the net.</p>
            <p>Sukaraja Beach, which may have been cleaner in the past, is now covered in piles of waste carried by the waves. However, even though the beach has been littered with waste, the fishermen are still faithful to their activities there. Every day they have to struggle with not only fish, but also trash that gets caught in their nets. “This garbage is not from our neighborhood,” says Rudi, a fisherman who has been living on this beach for decades. “Maybe it’s from other areas, or it’s attracted here by the waves.”</p>
            <p>The continuous waste not only eyesores the scenery, but also affects the catch. Rudi realizes that life as a fisherman is getting harder. “In one day, we sometimes only get five kilograms of fish, sometimes even less, per day sometimes only bring IDR 10,000 – 20,000.” he complained. This uncertainty makes them have to work harder, hoping to bring home more fish and money for their families.</p>
            <p>When asked about the threat of microplastics hidden in seawater, Rudi simply shakes his head. “I don’t know what microplastics are,” he says with a weak smile. For him, waste on the beach is just part of the job they have to deal with every day. The bigger concern for Rudi and his colleagues is the decreasing catch and the uncertainty that surrounds their future.</p>
            <p>Amongst the piles of waste, in the middle of the waves that keep coming, the fishermen of Sukaraja Beach are surviving. They don’t know what the future holds, but one thing is for sure, they will continue to cast their nets, with hope and enthusiasm that never fades, despite the changing world around them.</p>
